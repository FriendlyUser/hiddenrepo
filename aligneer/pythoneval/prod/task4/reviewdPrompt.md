I am encountering an issue with a dynamic pricing function in Python that is not behaving as intended. The `update_prices` function is designed to adjust item prices in real time based on specified demand factors. However, it is not updating the prices as expected. Below is the code snippet:

```python
def update_prices(items, demand_factors):
    for item in items:
        price = item['base_price'] * demand_factors.get(item['id'], 1)
        item['price'] == price
    return items
```

Could you help identify and debug any syntax or logic errors in this code? Additionally, I would appreciate suggestions for improvements to enhance the function's performance, reliability, and maintainability.
