Currently under problem with a dynamic pricing function in Python that's misbehaving. The update_prices function is supposed to adjust item prices in real time based on demand factors, but it's not updating the prices as expected. Here's the code snippet: def update_prices(items, demand_factors): for item in items: price = item['base_price'] * demand_factors.get(item['id'], 1) item['price'] == price return items Could you help me debug this function to fix any errors and possibly suggest improvements for better performance?
