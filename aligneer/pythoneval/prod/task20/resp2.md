Here's an improved version of your code that implements all the requested features:

```python
import concurrent.futures
import psycopg2
from psycopg2 import Error as PostgresError
import time
from typing import List, Optional, Any
import logging

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def create_db_connection():
    """Create and return a database connection."""

        result = fetch_film_with_retry(film_id)
        results_dict[position] = result

    # Use ThreadPoolExecutor for concurrent execution
    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5) as executor:
        # Submit all tasks and store futures
        futures = [
            executor.submit(fetch_and_store, film_id, i)
            for i, film_id in enumerate(film_ids)

    try:
        results = get_film_data(film_ids)
        
        # Process results
        for film_id, result in zip(film_ids, results):
            if result is None:
                print(f"Failed to fetch data for film_id: {film_id}")
            else:

    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error in main execution: {str(e)}")
```

Key improvements in this version:

1. **Exception Handling**:
   - Catches specific PostgreSQL errors using `psycopg2.Error`
   - Implements proper connection cleanup in finally blocks
   - Includes logging for error tracking

2. **Retry Logic**:
   - Implements retry mechanism with exponential backoff
   - Configurable maximum number of retries (default: 3)
   - Waits longer between each retry attempt (1s, 2s, 4s)

3. **Order Preservation**:
   - Uses a dictionary to store results with their original positions
   - Returns results in the same order as input film_ids
   - Failed queries return None instead of crashing

4. **Additional Features**:
   - Proper connection management
   - Logging configuration
   - Type hints for better code clarity
   - Separate connection creation function
   - Better resource cleanup

5. **Usage Example**:
   - Includes example usage code
   - Demonstrates how to handle both successful and failed results

To use this code:

```python
# Example usage
film_ids = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
results = get_film_data(film_ids)

# Process results
for film_id, result in zip(film_ids, results):
    if result is not None:
        print(f"Film {film_id} data: {result}")
    else:
        print(f"Failed to fetch data for film {film_id}")
```

This implementation will:
- Handle database errors gracefully
- Retry failed queries up to three times
- Maintain the order of results
- Not crash on individual query failures
- Provide logging for debugging
- Clean up resources properly

The code is also more maintainable and includes type hints for better IDE support and code documentation.
