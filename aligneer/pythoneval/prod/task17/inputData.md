Act as a professional software developer, code is separated by ```, sections by ---, perform analyze and answer each question based on best practises. We have a prompt, document (providing guidelines on response format and criteria), and responses 1 and 2 coming from a intermediate software developer. Then answer a series of questions.

Given the following revised prompt:

Revised Prompt:
---
I've been dealing with some issues in our data pipeline the incoming data is all over the place. Wrote this function to process it, but I'm not sure if it's solid. The data could be lists of dicts, dicts with lists, nested keys, missing values, you name it. Need to make sure it doesn't break with unexpected inputs. Think you could come up with some unit tests for this? Not sure if I've thought of everything.

def process_data(data):
    result = []
    for item in data:
        try:
            value = item.get('value', 0.0)
            if isinstance(value, dict):
                nested_value = value.get('nested_value', 0.0)
                if isinstance(nested_value, list):
                    accum = 0.0
                    for v in nested_value:
                        accum += float(v)
                    result.append(accum)
                else:
                    result.append(float(nested_value))
            elif isinstance(value, list):
                for v in value:
                    result.append(float(v))
            else:
                result.append(float(value))
        except (ValueError, TypeError):
            continue
    total = sum(result)
    average = total / len(result) if result else 0.0
    return {'total': total, 'average': average, 'count': len(result)}

Instructions & Guidelines for the delivery
Task Introduction
The primary goal of this task is to test and evaluate an AI assistant’s capabilities in the area of backend
development for the following five use cases:
Code Generation, Test Case Generation, Code Explanation / Q&A, Refactoring, Debugging.
You will interact with the model - in line with the task instruction guidance below - mirroring what real users
may seek assistance for in relation to backend development.
You are expected to first generate a realistic prompt that challenges the model to complete tasks relating to
one or more of the above use cases - e.g. “generate me some code that does X”, “refactor this existing code
base, focusing on Y”, etc. and submit them to the model.
Note: to help assist with prompt generation, we will be providing an example prompt alongside each
datarow that can serve as a starting point - these prompts have been augmented to leverage either readily
available packages that can be easily downloaded, or interact with applications such as flask (which you can
run yourself) or a Postgres and MySQL database we have provisioned for this work (see below for details).
Some of these prompts may run in their current form or need some minor edits to get running. Keep in
mind for the prompts asking for debugging of the presented code segment, the code might be intended
to be broken in the first place, hence the need to ask the LLM to debug
There is no obligation to leverage the example prompt for each datarow, but please do use these as a starting
point for inspiration around the type of question and complexity we would be looking to ask.
In all cases you are expected to ensure your prompt is appropriate (e.g. runs as expected, or is broken as
expected if asking for debugging)
For each prompt you will get one AI-generated response which you will evaluate across various dimensions.
As the model outputs will be slightly different across the above task types we propose to split this
task out into those that will generate code as part of the output (Code Generation, Test Case
Generation, Refactoring, and Debugging) vs those that will simply provide analysis of inputted code
(Code Explanation / Q&A).
For tasks that require the model to output code as part of the response, the dimensions have been
specifically tailored to assess the quality of the code generated:
● Correctness: The code should execute fully with no errors, meet all requirements specified in the
prompt, and must perform its intended functionality
● Readability: The code should be easy to read and understand, use meaningful and logical variable
and function naming convention, and include relevant and clean comments where necessary to
explain the logic flow - note you can also make some allowance in here for easy to follow commentary
provided by the LLM to accompany the code
● Scalability: The code should be modularised appropriately, use consistent coding standards and style,
and have appropriate error handling where relevant
● Efficiency: The code should be well optimized for time and space constraints where appropriate.
For tasks that require the model to generate just insight about inputted code, in a natural language
format, the dimensions will be more generalized and focused on the analysis and communicative skills of the
model:
● Truthfulness: The response should be correct and accurate in its analysis of the inputted code.
● Helpfulness: The response should specifically answer any requests raised by the user in the prompt,
while adhere to any specific guidance provided by the user
● Completeness: The response must be complete and detailed in the analysis and answers provided
● Writing Style: The response should be returned in a clear, structured manner, providing the correct
balance between detail without being overly verbose.
Note: we will be splitting these two types of response out into two different projects, in order to account for
the different rating criteria associated.
AI Assistant Expected Behavior
The main goal of the AI Assistant is to help the user accomplish various coding related tasks. In practice, this
means that the AI Assistant should:
● Respond only with the information requested in the prompt.
● Respond strictly in the form and format as indicated in the prompt.
Known Limitations (do not penalize)
● The model does not have up-to-date information and/or access to the internet and should not be
expected to have access to current information in its responses.
● The model does not have the ability to generate anything other than text, so you should not
instruct it to do so and not penalize these limitations.
Step-by-Step Instructions
You will be performing the following sequence of actions in that order.
1. Prompt Creation & Classification:
Begin by generating a prompt that falls within one or more of the following tasks:
○ Code Generation
○ Test Case Generation
○ Code Explanation / Q&A
○ Refactoring
○ Debugging
Note: We will be dealing with Code Explanation / Q&A in a separate project set up, given that
the criteria we will evaluate these responses against will be different to responses that we
explicitly want to generate output code.
Your prompt should be either structured or messy to mimic real-world usage of AI assistants. Follow
the indicated 70/30 split below (i.e. out of 10 prompts, 7 should be structured and 3 should be messy).
○ Structured (70%): Prompts that are well-defined with precise instructions and typically include
specific requirements or constraints.
○ Messy (30%): Prompts that are vague or incomplete. They might be ambiguous, have unclear
goals, or contain errors. This reflects how real-world users sometimes interact with AI -
especially if they are unsure about the technical details or are not entirely certain of the task
requirements.
Upon prompt creation/refinement of your prompt you will be expected to classify both the task and
prompt type of the prompt from the drop-down menu in the editor. (note this happens at the end of
the editor.
2. Response Rating:
You will then review and evaluate the AI-generated response based on the following criteria:
- Code Generation, Test Case Generation, Refactoring, and Debugging
a. Correctness
b. Readability
c. Scalability
d. Efficiency
- Code Explanation / Q&A
a. Truthfulness
b. Helpfulness
c. Completeness
d. Writing Style
Note: For responses that we explicitly expect the model to output code for (Code Generation, Test
Case Generation, Refactoring, and Debugging), you will be expected to try to execute the code to
inform your ratings (more details of this are provided below). A lot of insight around the ratings will be
informed by whether the code works as expected, how robust and efficient it is, etc.
Having reviewed the output (and validated any output code) you will be expected to then rank the
model response against the relevant criteria, in line with the guidance below.
Note: there is no expectation to fully refactor the code yourself, although very minor edits, formatting
changes (e.g. linting), replacing of placeholders, or piecing together of the code response might be
necessary to get the code to a stage where you can fairly evaluate the logic returned by the models
3. Rating Justification:
In all cases you will then be asked to provide a succinct free-text response to explain and justify the
rankings given
4. [Additional] Code Execution Log:
Note: For the tasks above where we expect code to be explicitly generated, you will be expected to
paste the output log from your code execution into a free-text response box to A) validate you have
executed the code as required, B) provide supporting evidence against the relevant criteria rankings
awarded (e.g. show that errors were thrown if the code was incorrectly generated)

Rating Guide
You will be expected to classify the prompt and responses received against the following criteria. Note that
responses for “Code Explanation / Q&A” follow distinct rating criteria than any responses containing code.
(0) Prompt Classification
Upon your generation of the prompt, please use the drop-down menu to classify its:
● Task (Code Generation, Test Case Generation, Code Explanation / Q&A, Refactoring,
Debugging)
● Type (messy vs. structured)
(Optional) Skip Rating
In case the model is unable to provide an answer to your prompt (e.g. “I am not able to answer that type of
question), please skip this datarow without any ratings.
A. Tasks Involving Output Code: Code Generation, Test Case Generation, Refactoring, Debugging
(1) Correctness:
Verify that the code executes fully without errors and meets all the requirements specified in the prompt.
Ensure it performs its intended functionality correctly.
Example: If the prompt is to generate a function that calculates the factorial of a number, the code should
correctly return the factorial for any given input without throwing errors.
● 3 (Correct): The code executes fully, meets all requirements, and performs the intended functionality
correctly.
● 2 (Partially Correct): The code executes but contains minor errors or does not fully meet all
requirements.
● 1 (Incorrect): The code does not execute or contains significant errors that prevent it from meeting the
prompt requirements.
(2) Readability:
Assess whether the response is easy to read and understand. Ensure the code is well-organized, uses clear
and descriptive variable names, and includes comments or docstrings where necessary to explain the logic or
purpose. Avoid over-complication or redundant details that reduce readability.
You can also give some weighting here to how useful any instruction or commentary the model provides
surrounding the code, but do be sure to mainly focus on the code itself and the comments within the
code.
Example: For a response generating a REST API endpoint, check that the code structure is logical in the
order it is delivered, variable names like “user_id” are meaningful, and any complex sections are accompanied
by concise comments explaining their purpose.
● 3 (Readable): The code is easy to read and understand, uses meaningful names, and includes
appropriate comments.
● 2 (Moderately Readable): The code is readable but could benefit from better naming conventions or
additional comments.
● 1 (Unreadable): The code is difficult to read or understand, uses poor naming conventions, and lacks
necessary comments.
(3) Scalability:
Assess whether the code is modularized appropriately, uses consistent coding standards and style, and has
appropriate error handling. This should ensure that the code can be easily extended or modified for future
expansion, and to handle increasingly high-load scenarios.
Example: The code should be divided into functions or classes where appropriate, follow consistent style
guidelines, and handle potential errors gracefully. Ensure the response is designed to scale effectively for
larger inputs or increased demands
● 3 (Scalable): The code is well modularized, consistent in style, and includes robust error handling.
● 2 (Moderately Scalable): The code is somewhat modular but could be improved in consistency and
error handling.
● 1 (Not Scalable): The code is not modular, lacks consistency in style, and has inadequate error
handling.
(4) Efficiency:
Evaluate the optimization of the code in terms of time and space complexity where appropriate. Check if the
code performs efficiently under expected workloads.
Example: If the prompt asks for a function to sort a list of integers, ensure that the provided solution uses an
efficient algorithm like Timsort rather than a suboptimal one like Bubble Sort.
● 3 (Efficient): The code is well optimized and performs efficiently under expected workloads.
● 2 (Moderately Efficient): The code is somewhat optimized but has room for improvement.
● 1 (Inefficient): The code is not optimized and performs poorly in terms of time and space complexity.
B. Tasks Involving Only Natural Language Output: Code Explanation / Q&A
(1) Truthfulness:
The response should be correct and accurate in its analysis of the inputted code. Verify that the response
correctly analyzes the code input, and is accurate in its assessment of what the code is doing and how the
functionality performs - ensuring any of the model claims are factually accurate.
Example: If the code segment involves a function that sorts an array, the response should correctly explain
the sorting algorithm used and its complexity
● 3 (Truthful): The response is fully correct, with accurate and detailed specification of what the queried
code is doing. There are no inaccuracies in the logic it has stated.
● 2 (Partially Truthful): The response is mostly correct but has minor errors or inconsistencies that
impact the user’s understanding of the code functionality.
● 1 (Inaccurate): The response is incorrect, with significant inaccuracies. It has either completely
misunderstood what the code is doing, or it has provided unrelated information (hallucinations).
(2) Helpfulness
Rate how well the response addresses the specific requests and questions raised in the prompt. It should
follow any specific guidance provided by the user, and should be sure to provide the user with only the
information required about the code that will answer the user’s original question.
Example: If the user asks for an explanation of how a particular function works, the response should focus on
that function and its role within the code.
● 3 (Helpful): The response thoroughly addresses the user's requests and follows any provided
guidance that was specified - e.g. returning in a desired format.
● 2 (Moderately Helpful): The response addresses the user's requests but lacks depth or specificity to
provide a meaningful answer to what the user is after - e.g. could be too high level or not follow
specific instructions around the output desired.
● 1 (Unhelpful): The response fails to address the user's specific requests or guidance.
(3) Completeness
Assess whether the response provides a detailed and thorough analysis of the code. It should cover all
relevant aspects and leave no important points unexplained
Example: If the user asks for an explanation of error handling in a given code snippet, ensure that the
response not only explains the error handling mechanisms but also addresses any potential gaps or
improvements.
● 3 (Complete): The response is thorough and comprehensive, covering all aspects of the user’s
request with detailed and relevant analysis or answers.
● 2 (Partially Complete): The response addresses some parts of the user’s request but leaves gaps in
coverage or analysis. Additional detail or components that are relevant to the original request, are
needed for full completeness.
● 1 (Incomplete): The response is missing key parts of the user’s request or lacks sufficient detail,
making it unhelpful or inadequate.
(4) Writing Style
Rate the clarity, structure, and balance of detail in the response. Ensure that it is well-organized, easy to read,
and provides sufficient detail without being overly verbose or redundant. Confirm that the tone and language
are professional and appropriate for backend developers.
Example: For a response explaining the use of a specific API function, check that the explanation is logically
structured, uses consistent terminology, and avoids unnecessary complexity, enabling the user to understand
the API’s purpose and usage clearly.
● 3 (Clear): The response is well-organized, easy to follow, and strikes the right balance of detail. The
writing is professional and clear, aiding the user’s understanding.
● 2 (Moderately Clear): The response is somewhat organized but could benefit from better structure,
conciseness, or improved language to enhance clarity. It is readable but not optimal.
● 1 (Unclear): The response is poorly structured, overly verbose, or lacks clarity, making it difficult for the
user to follow or understand.
Provision DataBases
The focus of this project is around backend engineering, therefore we have provisioned a MySQL and
Postgres database with adequate read only permissions.
In order to enable members of this evaluation team to test outputted code that looks to read or interact with a
relevant database, we have provisioned a MySQL and Postgres database with some dummy data within.
In many cases the database details have been provided in the prompt and therefore are already accounted for
in the response, but you should always double check this. The relevant details are as follows:
MySQL
- Username: readonly_user (SELECT only permissions)
- Password: labeling_now
- Host: admin.c58u848ggx5b.us-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com
- Database: pagila
- Schema: https://public-bucket-ramy.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mysql-pagila.png
Postgres
- Username: readonly_user (SELECT only permissions)
- Password: labeling_now
- Host: postgres.c58u848ggx5b.us-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com
- Database: pagila
- Schema: https://public-bucket-ramy.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/postgres-pagila.png
Observing the Data
While the schemas have been provided above, you may find it beneficial to connect with the above credentials
in order to fully explore the database and see the content types of data within specific tables.
In the event of this,, it may be helpful to use the likes of DataGrip or a VSCode plugin to view the database(s)
in more detail.

Formatting
The format of your prompt can impact greatly on the quality of the model response. It is therefore critical that
you ensure you are leveraging punctuation correctly to make your prompt format as logic as possible
Prompt Input Formats:
The expectation is for a variety of prompts to be submitted to test the model against various facets. This
means in practice you should provide prompts that vary in structure, from:
● Messy prompt (broader General QA): e.g. “provide me a code segment that does X”
● Structured prompt (specific instruction following prompts): e.g. “Given the following code snippet:
{INSERT CODE}, please refactor it for improved modularisation, pay close attention to adding relevant
comments on function uses, and ensure the linting accounts for max line length = 80 and indentation =
4”
You will be responsible for ensuring the prompt structure is sufficient to elicit the correct response from the
model API. Note, this is particularly important for tasks where you are presenting the model with some
input code - e.g. for Code Explanation / QA, Refactoring, Debugging, etc. You must ensure that you structure
your prompt correctly to enable the model to differentiate between the natural language part of your prompt,
and the code segments provided to it.
Code Execution
When it comes to code execution to validate responses you will be expected to do so in your own IDE
In all cases where code is returned in the response, you will need to execute the code returned to assess:
- That it runs as intended and delivers the expected output.
- That there are no errors contained and the code is robust in how it handles error edge-cases.
You will leverage the code execution to determine where there are issues or faults with the code, or where
optimisation and improvement can be found. These findings will inform your evaluation of the model
response, as per the Ranking Guide presented below.
In such cases, you will execute the code as originally returned (note some LLM responses might need
reformatting/indenting to work properly).
Follow these guidelines for the execution of code:
● Software and Environment Installation
○ IDE Recommendation: Use Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
○ Download and Install VS Code if you do not already have it (or other appropriate IDE)
○ Install Python Extension (e.g. in VS Code)
● Python Installation
○ Check if python is installed by running python - - version in the terminal.
○ If you do not have python downloaded, you can download it here
● Create and Build Project Folder
○ Create a new folder on your Desktop and open it in VS Code: File > Open Folder …
○ Recommended: create and activate a virtual environment to avoid installing packages onto
your base machine
■ $ Python3 -m venv venv
■ $ source ./venv/bin/activate
● A note on dependencies
○ For the most part in evaluation all the dependencies will be clear from the import statements in
the code base returned by the models
○ Be sure to install these using whichever preferred package repository you use (e.g. PyPI, etc.)
○ The one major dependency you might need to install for evaluation is “postgresql”
(e.g. “$ brew instal postgresql” or alternative package installer than brew)l
● Create your programs
○ Create appropriately named .py files and paste your code
○ Make minor adjustments to the code base required.
Note, slightly indentation issues are somewhat expected in the models responses in
evaluation (and can be easily fixed with linting), these are less severe than actual errors in the
code itself

For response 1 and response 2

Response 1:

I'll help you create a comprehensive set of unit tests for your `process_data` function. Let's test various scenarios and edge cases:

```python
import unittest

class TestProcessData(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_simple_values(self):
        data = [
            {'value': 1.0},
            {'value': 2.0},
            {'value': 3.0}
        ]
        expected = {'total': 6.0, 'average': 2.0, 'count': 3}
        self.assertEqual(process_data(data), expected)

    def test_nested_dict_values(self):
        data = [
            {'value': {'nested_value': 1.0}},
            {'value': {'nested_value': 2.0}}
        ]
        expected = {'total': 3.0, 'average': 1.5, 'count': 2}
        self.assertEqual(process_data(data), expected)

    def test_nested_list_values(self):
        data = [
            {'value': {'nested_value': [1.0, 2.0]}},
            {'value': {'nested_value': [3.0, 4.0]}}
        ]
        expected = {'total': 10.0, 'average': 5.0, 'count': 2}
        self.assertEqual(process_data(data), expected)

    def test_list_values(self):
        data = [
            {'value': [1.0, 2.0]},
            {'value': [3.0, 4.0]}
        ]
        expected = {'total': 10.0, 'average': 2.5, 'count': 4}
        self.assertEqual(process_data(data), expected)

    def test_missing_values(self):
        data = [
            {},
            {'value': None},
            {'value': 1.0}
        ]
        expected = {'total': 1.0, 'average': 1.0, 'count': 1}
        self.assertEqual(process_data(data), expected)

    def test_invalid_values(self):
        data = [
            {'value': 'not_a_number'},
            {'value': 1.0},
            {'value': [1.0, 'invalid', 2.0]}
        ]
        expected = {'total': 4.0, 'average': 1.333333333333333, 'count': 3}
        self.assertEqual(process_data(data), expected)

    def test_empty_input(self):
        data = []
        expected = {'total': 0.0, 'average': 0.0, 'count': 0}
        self.assertEqual(process_data(data), expected)

    def test_mixed_types(self):
        data = [
            {'value': 1},
            {'value': '2.0'},
            {'value': 3.0}
        ]
        expected = {'total': 6.0, 'average': 2.0, 'count': 3}
        self.assertEqual(process_data(data), expected)

    def test_nested_empty_structures(self):
        data = [
            {'value': {}},
            {'value': []},
            {'value': {'nested_value': []}},
            {'value': {'nested_value': {}}}
        ]
        expected = {'total': 0.0, 'average': 0.0, 'count': 0}
        self.assertEqual(process_data(data), expected)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

These tests cover:

1. Simple numeric values
2. Nested dictionary values
3. Nested list values within dictionaries
4. List values
5. Missing or None values
6. Invalid/non-numeric values
7. Empty input
8. Mixed types (int, float, string numbers)
9. Empty nested structures

Some potential improvements for your function could include:

1. Add input validation for the data parameter
2. Consider adding a maximum recursion depth for nested structures
3. Add logging for skipped/invalid values
4. Consider adding type hints for better code documentation
5. Add parameter for custom handling of invalid values
6. Consider adding options for handling division by zero

Would you like me to suggest any specific improvements to the function itself?

Response 2:

To ensure your `process_data` function is robust and handles various edge cases, you should write unit tests that cover a wide range of possible inputs. Here are some unit tests you can consider:

1. **Test with an empty list**: Ensure the function handles an empty input gracefully.

2. **Test with missing 'value' key**: Check how the function behaves when the 'value' key is missing in some or all dictionaries.

3. **Test with non-numeric values**: Include non-numeric values in the 'value' or 'nested_value' fields to see if the function skips them without breaking.

4. **Test with nested dictionaries**: Ensure the function correctly processes nested dictionaries with 'nested_value' keys.

5. **Test with lists of numbers**: Verify that lists of numbers are processed correctly.

6. **Test with mixed types**: Include a mix of dictionaries, lists, and other types to see if the function can handle them.

7. **Test with large numbers**: Check if the function can handle very large numbers without precision issues.

8. **Test with negative numbers**: Ensure the function correctly processes negative numbers.

9. **Test with single element**: Check the function's behavior with a single element in the list.

10. **Test with nested lists**: Although not explicitly handled, see how the function behaves with nested lists.

Here's how you might write these tests using a testing framework like `unittest` in Python:

```python
import unittest

class TestProcessData(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_empty_list(self):
        data = []
        result = process_data(data)
        self.assertEqual(result, {'total': 0.0, 'average': 0.0, 'count': 0})

    def test_missing_value_key(self):
        data = [{'other_key': 10}]
        result = process_data(data)
        self.assertEqual(result, {'total': 0.0, 'average': 0.0, 'count': 0})

    def test_non_numeric_values(self):
        data = [{'value': 'abc'}, {'value': {'nested_value': ['xyz']}}]
        result = process_data(data)
        self.assertEqual(result, {'total': 0.0, 'average': 0.0, 'count': 0})

    def test_nested_dictionaries(self):
        data = [{'value': {'nested_value': [1, 2, 3]}}]
        result = process_data(data)
        self.assertEqual(result, {'total': 6.0, 'average': 6.0, 'count': 1})

    def test_lists_of_numbers(self):
        data = [{'value': [1, 2, 3]}]
        result = process_data(data)
        self.assertEqual(result, {'total': 6.0, 'average': 2.0, 'count': 3})

    def test_mixed_types(self):
