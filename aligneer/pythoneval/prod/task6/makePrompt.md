I need assistance writing unit tests for a Python function using `pytest`. The function processes data from a PostgreSQL database (`pagila`) using the provided connection details. It retrieves customer data from the `customer` table, extracts relevant entities, and returns them as a list of dictionaries.

Expectations for testing:

- **Unit Testing**: Ensure thorough and isolated testing of the function's logic.
- **Edge Cases**: Test scenarios like empty result sets, malformed data entries, and unexpected values.
- **Null Values**: Verify that the function gracefully handles `NULL` values returned for any of the expected fields.
- **Robustness**: Validate the function's behavior when the database returns incorrect or incomplete rows.

Here is the function to be tested:

```python
def extract_customer_entities(db_connection):
    """
    Retrieves customer data from the database and extracts entities.
    """
    try:
        cursor = db_connection.cursor()
        cursor.execute("SELECT customer_id, first_name, last_name, email FROM customer")
        customers = cursor.fetchall()
        entities = []
        for customer in customers:
            entity = {
                'customer_id': customer[0],
                'first_name': customer[1],
                'last_name': customer[2],
                'email': customer[3]
            }
            entities.append(entity)
        return entities
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error extracting customer entities: {e}")
        return []
```

Could you help me write unit tests to ensure this function works correctly under all these conditions?
