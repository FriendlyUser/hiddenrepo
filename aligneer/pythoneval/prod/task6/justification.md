Both responses provide valuable test cases and use mocking to isolate the function logic. Response 1 is simpler and more direct, while Response 2 is more comprehensive, uses fixtures, and considers a wider range of error conditions. Despite the mismatch in expected errors for malformed data, Response 2 offers a more scalable and thorough testing approach. If choosing one, Response 2 is preferable due to its more extensive coverage and pytest-best practices (fixtures, parametrization), even though minor adjustments to the function or tests are needed to fully align expectations and implementation.
