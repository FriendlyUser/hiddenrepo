Spent all morning wrestling with integrating my TensorFlow model into a Flask app, but it is not cooperating. The server starts up fine, but as soon as I make a request to the '/predict' endpoint, the whole thing crashes without any helpful error messages. I have double-checked everything and can't figure out what's wrong. Here's the code snippet:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

app = Flask(__name__)

# Define a simple model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')

@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    data = request.get_json()
    # Ensure the input data is a NumPy array with the correct shape
    data_input = np.array([data])
    prediction = model.predict(data_input)
    return jsonify({'prediction': prediction.tolist()})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```
I can't shake the feeling that I am overlooking something simple, maybe related to how I am handling the input data or the model prediction. Any ideas on what's going wrong here?

Add error handling to the endpoint, specific if the number of features is inadequate, wrap in try catch block, explain if there are any errors and why its crashing.
