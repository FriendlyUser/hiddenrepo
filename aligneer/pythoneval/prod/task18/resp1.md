Certainly! To improve the performance and readability of your function, we can leverage NumPy's vectorized operations, which are generally faster than Python's native loops. Additionally, we can modularize the code by separating the noise generation into its own function. Here's a refactored version of your code:

```python
import numpy as np

def add_laplace_noise(data, epsilon):
    """
    Adds Laplace noise to the data for differential privacy.

    Parameters:
    - data: NumPy array of original data.
    - epsilon: Privacy parameter.

    Returns:
    - Noisy data as a NumPy array.
    """
    scale = 1 / epsilon
    noise = np.random.laplace(loc=0.0, scale=scale, size=data.shape)
    return data + noise

def generate_synthetic_data(original_data, epsilon):
    """
    Generates synthetic data with differential privacy guarantees.

    Parameters:
    - original_data: 2D list or NumPy array of original data.
    - epsilon: Privacy parameter.

    Returns:
    - Synthetic data as a NumPy array.
    """
    original_data = np.array(original_data)  # Ensure input is a NumPy array
    synthetic_data = add_laplace_noise(original_data, epsilon)
    return synthetic_data
```

### Key Improvements:

1. **Vectorization**: By using NumPy's vectorized operations, we eliminate the need for nested loops, which improves performance, especially on large datasets.

2. **Modularity**: The noise addition is separated into its own function, `add_laplace_noise`, which makes the code more modular and easier to maintain.

3. **Readability**: The code is more concise and easier to understand, with clear function definitions and parameter descriptions.

### Usage:

You can use the `generate_synthetic_data` function in the same way as before, but now it should be more efficient and easier to read. Just pass your original data and the privacy parameter $$\epsilon$$ to the function.
