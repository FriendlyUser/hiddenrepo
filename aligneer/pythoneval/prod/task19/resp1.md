I'll help you refactor the `count_word_frequency` function to make it more memory-efficient and robust. Here's the improved implementation with detailed explanations:

```python
def count_word_frequency(filename):
    """
    Count word frequencies in a text file using memory-efficient line-by-line processing.
    
    Args:
        filename (str): Path to the text file
        
    Returns:
        dict: Dictionary containing word frequencies
        
    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If the specified file doesn't exist
        IOError: If there's an error reading the file
        UnicodeDecodeError: If the file encoding is not compatible
    """
    word_counts = {}
    
    try:
        with open(filename, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
            # Process the file line by line using a generator
            for line in file:
                # Split the line into words
                words = line.strip().split()
                
                # Update word frequencies
                for word in words:
                    word_counts[word] = word_counts.get(word, 0) + 1
                    
    except FileNotFoundError:
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"The file '{filename}' was not found.")
    except IOError as e:
        raise IOError(f"Error reading file '{filename}': {str(e)}")
    except UnicodeDecodeError as e:
        raise UnicodeDecodeError(f"Error decoding file '{filename}': {str(e)}")
    
    return word_counts
```

Key improvements in this refactored version:

1. **Memory Efficiency**:
   - Instead of reading the entire file at once with `f.read()`, we process it line by line using a file iterator.
   - This approach significantly reduces memory usage for large files since only one line is held in memory at a time.

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Added comprehensive error handling for common file operations.
   - Specific exceptions for different error cases (file not found, IO errors, encoding issues).
   - Meaningful error messages that include the filename and error details.

3. **Code Optimization**:
   - Used `dict.get()` method instead of explicit `if-else` checking, making the code more concise.
   - Added explicit UTF-8 encoding specification for better compatibility.

4. **Documentation**:
   - Added detailed docstring explaining the function's purpose, parameters, return value, and possible exceptions.

Example usage:

```python
try:
    frequencies = count_word_frequency("sample.txt")
    print(frequencies)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

The memory complexity of this refactored version is O(n) where n is the number of unique words in the file, rather than O(m) where m is the total file size. This makes it much more efficient for processing large files.

To demonstrate the memory efficiency, here's a comparison of memory usage for a large file:

```python
# Original version (for a 1GB file):
# Memory usage ≈ 1GB + overhead for word_counts dictionary

# Refactored version (for a 1GB file):
# Memory usage ≈ size of largest line + overhead for word_counts dictionary
```

The refactored version can handle files much larger than available RAM, as long as individual lines are not too long and there's enough memory to store the word frequency dictionary.
