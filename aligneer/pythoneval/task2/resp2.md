To make your Flask application scalable and fault-tolerant, and to ensure it follows PEP-8 guidelines, we can make several improvements. Here are the changes and enhancements:
 

 1. **PEP-8 Compliance**: Ensure proper naming conventions and spacing.
 2. **Database Connection Management**: Use a connection pool to manage database connections efficiently.
 3. **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for sensitive information like database credentials.
 4. **Error Handling**: Improve error handling for better fault tolerance.
 5. **Logging**: Add logging for better traceability.
 

 Here's the revised code:
 

 ```python
 from flask import Flask, jsonify
 import psycopg2
 from psycopg2 import pool
 import os
 import logging
 

 app = Flask(__name__)
 

 # Configure logging
 logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
 

 # Database connection details from environment variables
 DB_HOST = os.getenv('DB_HOST', 'postgres.c58u848ggx5b.us-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com')
 DB_USER = os.getenv('DB_USER', 'readonly_user')
 DB_PORT = os.getenv('DB_PORT', '5432')
 DB_PASSWORD = os.getenv('DB_PASSWORD', 'your_password') # Replace with actual password or use a secret manager
 DB_NAME = os.getenv('DB_NAME', 'pagila')
 

 # Initialize connection pool
 try:
  connection_pool = psycopg2.pool.SimpleConnectionPool(
  1, 20, # Min and max connections
  user=DB_USER,
  password=DB_PASSWORD,
  host=DB_HOST,
  port=DB_PORT,
  database=DB_NAME
  )
  if connection_pool:
  logging.info("Connection pool created successfully")
 except Exception as e:
  logging.error(f"Error creating connection pool: {e}")
 

 @app.route('/data')
 def get_data():
  try:
  # Get a connection from the pool
  conn = connection_pool.getconn()
  if conn:
  logging.info("Successfully received a connection from the pool")
  cur = conn.cursor()
 

  # Execute a SELECT query
  cur.execute('SELECT * FROM actor LIMIT 10;')
  rows = cur.fetchall()
 

  # Close the cursor and return the connection to the pool
  cur.close()
  connection_pool.putconn(conn)
 

  return jsonify(rows)
  except Exception as e:
  logging.error(f"Error fetching data: {e}")
  return jsonify({'error': str(e)})
  finally:
  # Ensure the connection is returned to the pool in case of an error
  if conn:
  connection_pool.putconn(conn)
 

 if __name__ == '__main__':
  app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
 ```
 

 ### Key Changes:
 

 - **Connection Pooling**: We use `psycopg2.pool.SimpleConnectionPool` to manage database connections efficiently.
 - **Environment Variables**: Database credentials are fetched from environment variables for better security.
 - **Logging**: Added logging to track the application's behavior and errors.
 - **Error Handling**: Improved error handling to ensure connections are returned to the pool even if an error occurs.
 

 Make sure to set the environment variables (`DB_HOST`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_NAME`) in your deployment environment to avoid hardcoding sensitive information.
