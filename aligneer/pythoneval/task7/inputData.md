Act as a professional software developer, code is separated by ```, sections by ---, perform analyze and answer each question based on best practises. We have a prompt, document (providing guidelines on response format and criteria), and responses 1 and 2 coming from a intermediate software developer. Then answer a series of questions.

Given the following prompt:

Prompt:
---
I need your help with this task code using Python. It's giving me headaches. Here's what I have:
 ```python
 import psycopg2
 def get_stock(item_id):
  conn = psycopg2.connect(
  host='postgres.c58u848ggx5b.us-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com',
  port=5432,
  database='pagila',
  user='readonly_user',
  password='your_password_here'
  )
  cursor = conn.cursor()
  cursor.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM inventory WHERE film_id = %s", (item_id,))
  result = cursor.fetchone()[0]
  conn.close()
  return result
 print(get_stock(1))
 ```
 The problem is that sometimes the function doesn't return the correct stock count, especially when multiple requests are made at once. Maybe it's a concurrency issue or something? Also, I want to add logging to monitor execution times and catch any exceptions, but I'm not sure how to implement that.
 Could you refactor this code to handle these issues? Also, if possible, can you make it support bulk retrieval so we can process multiple items in one call?

Instructions & Guidelines - Evaluation
Task Introduction
The primary goal of this task is to test and evaluate an AI assistant’s capabilities in the area of backend
development for the following several use cases:
Code Generation, Test Case Generation, Code Explanation, Debugging.
In evaluation, you will be presented with an input prompt and two model responses with the model - mirroring
what real users may seek assistance for in relation to backend development.
You are expected to look over the prompt and understand what is being asked, and then review the two
responses provided, and evaluate them against 4 criteria that have been specifically tailored to assess the
quality of the code generated:
● Correctness: The code should execute fully with no errors, meet all requirements specified in the
prompt, and must perform its intended functionality
● Readability: The code should be easy to read and understand, use meaningful and logical variable
and function naming convention, and include relevant and clean comments where necessary to
explain the logic flow - note you can also make some allowance in here for easy to follow commentary
provided by the LLM to accompany the code
● Scalability: The code should be modularised appropriately, use consistent coding standards and style,
and have appropriate error handling where relevant
● Efficiency: The code should be well optimized for time and space constraints where appropriate.
Step-by-Step Instructions
You will be performing the following sequence of actions in that order.
1. Response Rating:
You will first need to review and evaluate the two AI-generated responses based on the following
criteria.
- Correctness
- Readability
- Scalability
- Efficiency
As there is code contained in the responses which seeks to address the original prompt, you
will be expected to try to execute the code to inform your ratings (more details of this are
provided below). A lot of insight around the ratings will be informed by whether the code works as
expected, how robust and efficient it is, etc.
Having reviewed the output (and validated the output code) you will be expected to then rank the
model response against the relevant criteria, in line with the guidance below.
Note: there is no expectation to fully refactor the code yourself, although very minor edits, formatting
changes (e.g. linting), replacing of placeholders, or piecing together of the code response might be
necessary to get the code to a stage where you can fairly execute the logic returned by the model
2. Preference Ranking:
After you have provided ratings against the criteria for both responses you will then be asked to pick a
preferred response. This will be based on the evaluation of the two responses in the above step
3. Preference Ranking Justification
You will then be provided with a free text field where you can provide in a few sentences justification
that supports the criteria rankings you have provided to the two responses and why you picked the
preferred response of the two
4. Prompt Classification (Topic & Type):
Lastly you will be asked to review the prompt again and classifying, firstly, which of the following topics
it is most relevant to:
○ Code Generation
○ Test Case Generation
○ Refactoring
○ Debugging
And then into which prompt type it fits:
○ Structured: Prompts that are well-defined with precise instructions and typically include
specific requirements or constraints.
○ Messy: Prompts that are vague or incomplete. They might be ambiguous, have unclear goals,
or contain errors. This reflects how real-world users sometimes interact with AI - especially if
they are unsure about the technical details or are not entirely certain of the task requirements.

3af9728eb4ee
Rating Guide
You will be expected to classify the responses against the following criteria.
(1) Correctness:
Verify that the code executes fully without errors and meets all the requirements specified in the prompt.
Ensure it performs its intended functionality correctly.
Example: If the prompt is to generate a function that calculates the factorial of a number, the code should
correctly return the factorial for any given input without throwing errors.
● 3 (Correct): The code executes fully, meets all requirements, and performs the intended functionality
correctly.
● 2 (Partially Correct): The code executes but contains minor errors or does not fully meet all
requirements.
● 1 (Incorrect): The code does not execute or contains significant errors that prevent it from meeting the
prompt requirements.
(2) Readability:
Assess whether the response is easy to read and understand. Ensure the code is well-organized, uses clear
and descriptive variable names, and includes comments or docstrings where necessary to explain the logic or
purpose. Avoid over-complication or redundant details that reduce readability. You can also give some
weighting here to how useful any instruction or commentary the model provides surrounding the code, but do
be sure to mainly focus on the code itself and the comments within the code.
Example: For a response generating a REST API endpoint, check that the code structure is logical in the
order it is delivered, variable names like “user_id” are meaningful, and any complex sections are accompanied
by concise comments explaining their purpose.
● 3 (Readable): The code is easy to read and understand, uses meaningful names, and includes
appropriate comments.
● 2 (Moderately Readable): The code is readable but could benefit from better naming conventions or
additional comments.
● 1 (Unreadable): The code is difficult to read or understand, uses poor naming conventions, and lacks
necessary comments.
(3) Scalability:
Assess whether the code is modularized appropriately, uses consistent coding standards and style, and has
appropriate error handling. This should ensure that the code can be easily extended or modified for future
expansion, and to handle increasingly high-load scenarios.
Example: The code should be divided into functions or classes where appropriate, follow consistent style
guidelines, and handle potential errors gracefully. Ensure the response is designed to scale effectively for
larger inputs or increased demands
● 3 (Scalable): The code is well modularized, consistent in style, and includes robust error handling.
● 2 (Moderately Scalable): The code is somewhat modular but could be improved in consistency and
error handling.
● 1 (Not Scalable): The code is not modular, lacks consistency in style, and has inadequate error
handling.
(4) Efficiency:
Evaluate the optimization of the code in terms of time and space complexity where appropriate. Check if the
code performs efficiently under expected workloads.
Example: If the prompt asks for a function to sort a list of integers, ensure that the provided solution uses an
efficient algorithm like Timsort rather than a suboptimal one like Bubble Sort.
● 3 (Efficient): The code is well optimized and performs efficiently under expected workloads.
● 2 (Moderately Efficient): The code is somewhat optimized but has room for improvement.
● 1 (Inefficient): The code is not optimized and performs poorly in terms of time and space complexity.
Provision DataBases
The focus of this project is around backend engineering, therefore we have provisioned a MySQL and
Postgres database with adequate read only permissions.
In order to enable members of this evaluation team to test outputted code that looks to read or interact with a
relevant database, we have provisioned a MySQL and Postgres database with some dummy data within.
In many cases the database details have been provided in the prompt and therefore are already accounted for
in the response, but you should always double check this. The relevant details are as follows:
MySQL
- Username: readonly_user (SELECT only permissions)
- Password: labeling_now
- Host: admin.c58u848ggx5b.us-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com
- Database: pagila
- Schema: https://public-bucket-ramy.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mysql-pagila.png
Postgres
- Username: readonly_user (SELECT only permissions)
- Password: labeling_now
- Host: postgres.c58u848ggx5b.us-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com
- Database: pagila
- Schema: https://public-bucket-ramy.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/postgres-pagila.png
Observing the Data
While the schemas have been provided above, you may find it beneficial to connect with the above credentials
in order to fully explore the database and see the content types of data within specific tables.
In the event of this,, it may be helpful to use the likes of DataGrip or a VSCode plugin to view the database(s)
in more detail.
Code Execution
When it comes to code execution to validate responses you will be expected to do so in your own IDE
In all cases where code is returned in the response, you will need to execute the code returned to assess:
- That it runs as intended and delivers the expected output.
- That there are no errors contained and the code is robust in how it handles error edge-cases.
- That the format is appropriate (i.e. adheres to specific linting guidelines if relevant).
You will leverage the code execution to determine where there are issues or faults with the code, or where
optimisation and improvement can be found. These findings will inform your evaluation of the model
response, as per the Ranking Guide presented below.
In such cases, you will execute the code as originally returned (note some LLM responses might need
reformatting/indenting to work properly).
Follow these guidelines for the execution of code:
● Software and Environment Installation
○ IDE Recommendation: Use Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
○ Download and Install VS Code if you do not already have it (or other appropriate IDE)
○ Install Python Extension (e.g. in VS Code)
● Python Installation
○ Check if python is installed by running python - - version in the terminal.
○ If you do not have python downloaded, you can download it here
● Create and Build Project Folder
○ Create a new folder on your Desktop and open it in VS Code: File > Open Folder ...
○ Recommended: create and activate a virtual environment to avoid installing packages onto
your base machine
■ $ Python3 -m venv venv
■ $ source ./venv/bin/activate
● A note on dependencies
○ For the most part in evaluation all the dependencies will be clear from the import statements in
the code base returned by the models
○ Be sure to install these using whichever preferred package repository you use (e.g. PyPI, etc.)
○ The one major dependency you might need to install for evaluation is “postgresql”
(e.g. “$ brew instal postgresql” or alternative package installer than brew)l
● Create your programs
○ Create appropriately named .py files and paste your code
○ Make minor adjustments to the code base required.
Note, slightly indentation issues are somewhat expected in the models responses in
evaluation (and can be easily fixed with linting), these are less severe than actual errors in the
code itself

  Args:
  item_ids: A list of item IDs to retrieve stock counts for.
 

  Returns:
  A dictionary mapping item IDs to their corresponding stock counts.
  """
 

  start_time = time.time()
  logging.info("Starting stock retrieval for item IDs: %s", item_ids)
 

  try:
  conn = psycopg2.connect(
  host='postgres.c58u848ggx5b.us-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com',
  port=5432,
  database='pagila',
  user='readonly_user',
  password='your_password_here'
  )

  cursor.execute(
  "SELECT film_id, COUNT(*) FROM inventory WHERE film_id IN %s GROUP BY film_id",
  (tuple(item_ids),)
  )
  else:
  cursor.execute(
  "SELECT film_id, COUNT(*) FROM inventory WHERE film_id = %s GROUP BY film_id",
  (item_ids,)
  )
  results = dict(cursor.fetchall())
  conn.close()
 

  logging.info("Finished stock retrieval in %.2f seconds", time.time() - start_time)
  return results
 

  except Exception as e:
  logging.error("An error occurred while retrieving stock: %s", e)
  raise # Re-raise the exception to be handled at a higher level if needed
 

 # Example usage for single and bulk retrieval
 print(get_stock(1))
 print(get_stock([1, 2, 3]))
 ```
 

 **Improvements:**
 

 - **Concurrency Handling:** The code now sets the transaction isolation level to `REPEATABLE READ`. This ensures that the data read for a particular transaction remains consistent throughout its duration, even if other transactions modify the data concurrently.
 - **Bulk Retrieval:** The function now accepts a list of item IDs and efficiently retrieves stock counts for all of them in a single database query.
 - **Logging:** The code now includes logging statements to record the start and end times of the function execution, as well as any exceptions that occur. This will help you monitor the performance of the function and debug any issues.
 - **Error Handling:** The code now includes a try-except block to catch any exceptions that occur during the database interaction. This prevents the application from crashing and allows you to handle errors gracefully.
 - **Parameterization:** The code now uses parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. This ensures that user-provided input is treated as data and not as part of the SQL command.
 

 **Explanation:**
 

 1. **Import Statements:** We import the necessary libraries: `psycopg2` for database interaction, `logging` for logging, and `time` for measuring execution time.
 2. **Logging Configuration:** We set up basic logging to output messages with timestamps, log levels, and messages.
 3. **`get_stock` Function:**
  - It takes a list of `item_ids` as input.
  - It logs the start of the operation.
  - It connects to the database using the provided credentials.
  - It sets the transaction isolation level to `REPEATABLE READ`.
  - It creates a cursor object to execute SQL queries.
  - It constructs and executes a parameterized SQL query to retrieve stock counts for the provided `item_ids`.
  - It fetches the results from the cursor and stores them in a dictionary.
  - It closes the database connection.
  - It logs the completion time of the operation.
  - It returns the dictionary of stock counts.
 4. **Error Handling:** The `try-except` block handles any exceptions that occur during the database interaction and logs the error message.
 5. **Example Usage:** The code demonstrates how to use the `get_stock` function for both single and bulk item ID retrieval.
 

 This refactored code addresses the concurrency issue, adds logging, and supports bulk retrieval, making it more robust and efficient.
---

And Response 2:
---
To address the issues you're facing, we can refactor the code to handle concurrency more effectively, add logging for monitoring, and support bulk retrieval of stock counts. Here's a revised version of your code:
 

 ```python
 import psycopg2
 import logging
 from contextlib import closing
 from time import time
 

 # Configure logging
 logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
 

 def get_stock(item_ids):
  """
  Retrieve stock counts for a list of item IDs.
 

  :param item_ids: List of item IDs to retrieve stock counts for.
  :return: Dictionary with item IDs as keys and stock counts as values.
  """
  stock_counts = {}
  try:
  with closing(psycopg2.connect(
  host='postgres.c58u848ggx5b.us-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com',
  port=5432,
  database='pagila',
  user='readonly_user',
  password='your_password_here'
  )) as conn:
  with conn.cursor() as cursor:
  start_time = time()
  query = "SELECT film_id, COUNT(*) FROM inventory WHERE film_id = ANY(%s) GROUP BY film_id"
  cursor.execute(query, (item_ids,))
  results = cursor.fetchall()
  for film_id, count in results:
  stock_counts[film_id] = count
  logging.info(f"Execution time: {time() - start_time:.2f} seconds")
  except Exception as e:
  logging.error(f"An error occurred: {e}")
  return stock_counts
 

 # Example usage
 print(get_stock(1))
 print(get_stock([1, 2, 3])) 
```
 

 ### Key Changes and Additions:
 

 1. **Bulk Retrieval**: The function now accepts a list of `item_ids` and retrieves stock counts for all of them in one query using the `ANY` SQL operator. This reduces the number of database calls and improves performance.
 

 2. **Logging**: Added logging to monitor execution times and catch exceptions. This will help you track the performance and identify any issues.
 

 3. **Context Management**: Used `contextlib.closing` to ensure that the database connection is properly closed, even if an error occurs. This is a more Pythonic way to handle resources.
 

 4. **Concurrency**: By using a single query to fetch multiple stock counts, the function is less likely to encounter concurrency issues compared to making multiple individual queries.
 

 5. **Error Handling**: Added a try-except block to catch and log any exceptions that occur during the database operations.
 

 This refactored code should be more robust and efficient, especially when handling multiple requests simultaneously.
