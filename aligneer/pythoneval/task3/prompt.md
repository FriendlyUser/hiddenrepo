I need your help with this task code using Python. It's giving me headaches. Here's what I have:
 ```python
 import psycopg2
 def get_stock(item_id):
  conn = psycopg2.connect(
  host='postgres.c58u848ggx5b.us-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com',
  port=5432,
  database='pagila',
  user='readonly_user',
  password='your_password_here'
  )
  cursor = conn.cursor()
  cursor.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM inventory WHERE film_id = %s", (item_id,))
  result = cursor.fetchone()[0]
  conn.close()
  return result
 print(get_stock(1))
 ```
 The problem is that sometimes the function doesn't return the correct stock count, especially when multiple requests are made at once. Maybe it's a concurrency issue or something? Also, I want to add logging to monitor execution times and catch any exceptions, but I'm not sure how to implement that.
 Could you refactor this code to handle these issues? Also, if possible, can you make it support bulk retrieval so we can process multiple items in one call?
