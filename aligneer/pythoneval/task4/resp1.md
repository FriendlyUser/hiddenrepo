To address the issues you're facing, we can refactor the code to include connection pooling, which will help manage multiple requests more efficiently. We'll also add logging to monitor execution times and catch exceptions. Additionally, I'll show you how to handle bulk queries.
 

 Here's the refactored code:
 

 ```python
 import logging
 import time
 from flask import Flask, jsonify, request
 from psycopg2 import pool
 from psycopg2.extras import RealDictCursor
 

 # Configure logging
 logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
 logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
 

 # Initialize Flask app
 app = Flask(__name__)
 

 # Set up a connection pool
 db_pool = pool.SimpleConnectionPool(
  1, # Minimum number of connections
  10, # Maximum number of connections
  host='postgres.c58u848ggx5b.us-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com',
  port=5432,
  user='readonly_user',
  password='dummy_password',
  database='pagila'
 )
 

 @app.route('/inventory-status', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
 def inventory_status():
  start_time = time.time()
  try:
  # Get a connection from the pool
  connection = db_pool.getconn()
  cursor = connection.cursor(cursor_factory=RealDictCursor)
 

  if request.method == 'POST':
  # Handle bulk queries
  inventory_ids = request.json.get('inventory_ids', [])
  if not inventory_ids:
  return jsonify({"error": "No inventory IDs provided"}), 400
 

  query = 'SELECT inventory_id, film_id, store_id, last_update FROM inventory WHERE inventory_id = ANY(%s)'
  cursor.execute(query, (inventory_ids,))
  else:
  # Handle GET request
  cursor.execute('SELECT inventory_id, film_id, store_id, last_update FROM inventory')
 

  inventory_data = cursor.fetchall()
  return jsonify(inventory_data)
 

  except Exception as e:
  logger.error(f"Error fetching inventory data: {e}")
  return jsonify({"error": "Internal server error"}), 500
 

  finally:
  # Close the cursor and return the connection to the pool
  cursor.close()
  db_pool.putconn(connection)
  execution_time = time.time() - start_time
  logger.info(f"Request processed in {execution_time:.2f} seconds")
 

 if __name__ == '__main__':
  app.run(debug=True)
 ```
 

 ### Key Changes:
 

 1. **Connection Pooling**: We use `psycopg2.pool.SimpleConnectionPool` to manage database connections efficiently. This helps handle multiple requests by reusing connections.
 

 2. **Logging**: We added logging to monitor execution times and catch exceptions. This will help you debug and understand the performance of your application.
 

 3. **Bulk Queries**: The endpoint now supports POST requests with a JSON body containing `inventory_ids`. This allows you to query multiple inventory items in one request.
 

 4. **Error Handling**: We added error handling to return a meaningful error message if something goes wrong.
 

 5. **RealDictCursor**: We use `RealDictCursor` to return query results as dictionaries, making the JSON response more readable.
 

 With these changes, your application should handle multiple requests more efficiently and provide better insights into its operation through logging.
