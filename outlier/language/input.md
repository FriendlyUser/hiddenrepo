üç° Task Types, Categories, and Subcategories
High level overview! Please go over the table below for the full details.

Please make sure to pay attention when you are crafting your prompt to fit the Type, Category and Subcategory. It's relatively easy to get this right and failure to do so will result in removal from the project. We want you to succeed, so please make sure you are taking care when doing this!



The same applies to the additional capability request. Crafting a prompt that does not fit with the capability requests you have selected will lead to removal from the project. This is super avoidable if you just double check :)

You will be assigned a specific task type for each prompt you generate. Specific descriptions are below:



üß†Understanding and Reasoning - Specific


This category focuses on prompts that guide the model to speak in a specific tone, emotion or response length

Example: The news about the tornado is heartbreaking.



 üë∑ Generation - Specific


This category focuses on prompts that explicitly ask the model to respond using a specific character, accent, speech pattern, emotion, or tone 

Example: Yawn and breathe deeply like you're on the verge of sleep



üßë‚Äçüíª Language and Knowledge - General


This category focuses on prompts that involve language-related tasks, casual conversations, and creative or interactive exchanges.



This type of task does not have a given subcategory. Your job is to choose at least one that fits the prompt you have in mind.

Identify the category within Language & Knowledge.
Choose at least one subcategory from the other task types.
Create your prompt.


‚ú® Recap: Each task type will be related to a category and subcategory that will provide the necessary context for your prompt to target a specific goal, except for Language and Knowledge‚ÄîGeneral. In this type of task, you must select at least one category and subcategory from the other two task types.

Encountering Cutoff Responses
In Vocal Riff, you may encounter response cutoffs as a üéß Response Judge.

If either of the responses is cutoff:

Please reroll the model call to get a new response until you get a noncut response. Recommended: only reroll up to three (3) times.
Mark that the response was cut off.
Evaluate the rest of the questions considering the response up to the cutoff sentence (e.g., the ‚Äúprecut response‚Äù)

Was the response cut off at the end? *  
If so, evaluate the remaining questions, considering the response before the cut-off.  

- ‚óã Yes | The response was cut off.  
- ‚óã No | The response did not cut off.

Kinds of Cutoffs You Might Encounter
Some cutoffs are obvious and can be found quickly by looking at the waveform (e.g., Cutoff Example 1), and others require listening to the end of the clip (e.g., Cutoff Example 2). In Cutoff Example 2, the response tries to start a new sentence but only outputs the noun ‚Äú...softer and less shiny. They -.‚Äù

One of the main components of the task on Vocal Riff is rating responses across a few different dimensions. You will evaluate several dimensions on a 1 to 5 scale as follows:

| Score | Meaning                                                                                       |
|-------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 - Needs Improvement | None (0%) of the category dimensions that are reflected in the prompt are correctly represented. |
| 2 - Below Expectations | Almost none (25%) of the category dimensions that are reflected in the prompt are correctly represented. |
| 3 - Meets Expectations | Roughly half (50%) of the category dimensions that are reflected in the prompt are correctly represented. |
| 4 - Exceeds Expectations | Most (75%) of the category dimensions that are reflected in the prompt are correctly represented. |
| 5 - Exceptional | All (100%) of the category dimensions that are reflected in the prompt are correctly represented. |

The dimensions on the Vocal Riff project can be grouped by Content vs. Delivery.

Content is the wording or what the response says. You can judge the content of a response by reading a transcript (if it is accurate).
Delivery is how the model conveys the response. You have to hear the recording to judge the delivery.


Here's a breakdown of each of the dimensions (also check them out in the Quick Start Guide). To access the tables shown in the video, check out the dimension sections in the Specification document. Response Judges will dive deeper into these ratings in a later module.

| Dimension                          | Question                                                                 | Illustration                                                                 | Content or Delivery?           |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Paralinguistic Understanding       | Does the **content** pick up on emotional cues that the user did not specifically ask for | The prompt voice is nervous, sad or rushed. A good response acknowledges or reacts to this in the content | **Content only**               |
| Speech Reasoning                   | Does the **content** answer the user‚Äôs prompt well and accurately?        | The prompt asks for directions. A good response provides accurate directions | **Content only**               |
| Speech Steerability                | Does the **delivery** align with the user‚Äôs **specific requests** for paralinguistic features like **tone, emotion, persona, accent, speed, texture, and voice effects**? | A user asks for the answer to be spoken in an Italian accent. A good response employs an Italian accent | **Delivery only**              |
| Implicit Speech Style Control      | Is the **delivery** in line with emotional cues that the user **did not specifically ask for** | The prompt voice is nervous, sad or rushed A good response adjusts its tone accordingly (e.g., empathetic or soothing) | **Delivery only**              |
|                                   | **This is Paralinguistic Understanding but for delivery instead of content** |                                                                              |                                |
| Audio Quality                      | Is the quality of the response crisp and clear?                           | A good response has no background noise whatsoever and is reminiscent of studio-quality recording | **Delivery only**              |
| Humanlikeness                      | Does the response sound humanlike or overly robotic?                      | A good response sounds natural                                               | **Content + Delivery**         |
| Expressiveness                     | Is the response good at conveying emotion?                                | A good response is good at conveying emotion. Note: this is not about conveying the right emotion in context; that would be SS or ISSC, depending on whether the prompt asked for the emotion explicitly. | **Delivery only**              |


At the start of the course, it was explained that Prompt Recorders will be responsible for creating, finalizing, and documenting assigned prompts, as well as evaluating the initial model responses. Meanwhile, a Response Judge will review the model responses, assign ratings, and rank the two responses, providing justification for their decisions.



To clarify further, we‚Äôve included examples below. These examples showcase actual prompt recordings completed during this project, along with the corresponding model responses. The evaluations focus on two of the seven dimensions covered in this course. Each example includes an explanation of why the model responses are considered correct or incorrect.



Correct Paralinguistic Understanding

Prompt:

 I was looking forward to cooking Thanksgiving dinner with my brother. He called me 10 minutes ago telling me he wouldn't be able to make it.

 Response:

 I'm so sorry to hear that. It's really disappointing when plans fall through, especially when it's something you were looking forward to doing with family. Did you have any special plans for the dish you were going to cook together?

 Justification:

The user was clearly sad in their prompt to the model. The response correctly identified the emotion of the prompt by using comforting words in the response: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry to hear that‚Äù as well as ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs disappointing..‚Äù thus demonstrating its understanding. Note: paralinguistic understanding is focused on the content rather than the delivery of the response (e.g., if a model is monotone but still provides words of comfort, it would still have good paralinguistic understanding).

Prompt:

I got a brand new PlayStation for my birthday! It's the best day of my life! I can now play my favorite games!


Response:

Ahh thats amazing news. Happy birthday to you. Congrations on the new Playstation thats such a great way to celebrate your special day. Have you spent a lot of time playing it so far?

Justifications are essential for teaching a large language model why one response is superior to the other.



üåü Ideal structure
The first sentence states the choice of side-by-side rating (i.e., your verdict).
The second sentence addresses if any response has major issues across the dimensions.
The subsequent sentences provide evidence and/or highlight additional issues. This can include positive evidence.


Tips for Writing a High-Quality Justification
‚òëÔ∏è Evaluate Content and Delivery In Conjunction

Review the content for accuracy, relevance, and clarity.
Assess the delivery for tone, style, and how well it matches the context or audience.
Ask: Does the response meet the needs of the question, and is it communicated effectively?
Note specific examples of effective or ineffective communication.


‚òëÔ∏è Focus on Details and Evidence

Pay attention to subtle cues or nuances in the response, such as phrasing or tone shifts.
Identify specific examples that illustrate the model‚Äôs positive or negative performance.
Record these examples for reference, using them to support your observations.


‚òëÔ∏è Be Objective and Consistent

Base your evaluation on observable facts, such as accuracy, clarity, and alignment with the question.
Avoid letting personal preferences or biases affect your judgment.
Apply the same evaluation criteria to all responses to maintain fairness.


‚òëÔ∏è Provide Constructive Feedback

Highlight what the model does well with specific examples.
Example: ‚ÄúThe model used clear, concise language that effectively addressed the user‚Äôs question.‚Äù
Suggest specific improvements for weaker areas.
Example: ‚ÄúThe response could include more examples to clarify complex ideas.‚Äù
Ôªø

‚ö†Ô∏è The justification should be comprehensive. It should address any deductions or violations that exist in Response 1 and Response 2.

‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure your justification and Likert ratings are consistent (i.e., if you choose 2, your justification should start with "Response 2 is better because...").



Below are guiding steps for writing a high-quality justification:


**Tip**  
Start with a verdict. Begin with a clear statement about which response is better.  

**Good Example**  
Response 2 is much better than Response 1.  

**Tip**  
Highlight key differentiating factors. Point out the main reasons one response is better.  

**Good Example**  
Response 2 gives one curry recipe that includes prawns.  

**Tip**  
Support with evidence by including specific evidence to back up your assessment.  

**Good Example**  
Response 1 includes two curry recipes - one for beef and the other for prawns, but the beef recipe needs to be revised. Response 2 includes one recipe for the correct ingredient: prawns.  

**Tip**  
Be thorough yet concise. Ensure your justification consists of all pertinent elements, but keep it focused on the main points.  

**Good Example**  
*üìù Combine the four sentences above.*

Updates and Change Log

Check for periodic updates and review any changes to stay successful on this task.



Dec 12, 2024
The initial model response review and rerolls is now the responsibility of the üéßResponse Judge!
üé§Prompt Recorders and üéß Response Judges please re-review  the latest updates to your respective workflows.
üéßResponse Judges will now be able to go straight to feedback for poor prompts rather than having to also conduct ratings and rankings. Note: this evaluation will be reviewed so as reminder, gaming the system using this question is not allowed.

‚ö†Ô∏èA disclaimer message specifying that model responses will not be generated  will now be displayed at the end of the üé§ Prompt Recorder tasks. Once the prompt recording is completed, the task must be submitted.




Dec 9, 2024
Clarification for üßë‚Äçüíª Language and Knowledge tasks.
 When selecting the additional capabilities, make sure to use only the subcategories listed on [Cbt] Speech Prompt Gen - Categories & Subcategories_v2 file. (e.g. if you are selecting Explicit Persona control >> Occupational voices, make sure that the voice requested is a Sports announcer, Radio DJ, Politician, Teacher, Preacher, Salesperson, Doctor, Lawyer or Chef, since those are the only subcategories listed on the file.)

Dec 5, 2024
Sensitive Topics section updated.

Dec 3, 2024
‚úÇÔ∏è Response Cutoff Section Update
FYI - you will be seeing a section update on the in-task project instructions (sections on the left hand side).
‚≠ê Ratings Update - using ‚Äò3‚Äôs for irrelevant dimensions
Not all dimensions are assessed in every task. Sometimes, certain dimensions are not relevant.
When dimensions are not relevant, use a rating of ‚Äò3‚Äô.
See this mentioned in the section here.
üìùExamples Added for Paralinguistic Understanding, Speech Reasoning, and Speech Steerability dimensions
Dimension Summary table has been updated here as well
See Paralinguistic Examples here

Speech Steerability Examples here

Dec 1, 2024
üåüNew task type:üéè Paired Emotions
This new task type focuses on prompts one may not know how to reply to without being given the tonal or emotional charge associated with the prompt.
There will be no category or subcategory.
See Paired Emotion Examples for inspiration.
üé§ Prompt Recorders: For these tasks, please ensure you have time to complete two (2) tasks back to back.
You will need to come up with a prompt that is ambiguous and would need tonal or emotional guidance for a responder  to respond appropriately.
You will then complete two tasks: (1) Record the prompt the first time with one tone/emotion and complete the rest of the task accordingly. (2) Record your prompt the second time with an alternative tone/emotion and complete the rest of the task accordingly.
The wording  must be EXACTLY the same for both tasks. The paralinguistics, intonation, and expressiveness may differ, but the text itself should be exactly the same.
Recommendations: (1) keep your prompts short, (2) minimize the use of words that have strong positive or negative connotations, and (3) use paralinguistics to convey your emotion.
üéß Response Judges
You may encounter some prompts that are repeated once with this task type. This is expected. You should not encounter prompts repeated more than once.
Similar to Understanding and Reasoning type prompts, tone and emotion in the recording are very important for a good prompt. If a prompt fails to capture the tone or emotion indicated, it should be marked a (1).

Nov 28, 2024
Additional Guidance on Explicit Persona Control and Explicit Accent Control
‚úÖ You should request generic personas or accents for Generation > Explicit Persona Control and Explicit Accent Control.
‚ùå DO NOT request specific characters (e.g., Homer Simpson, Achilles, Rapunzel, Tina Fey). While allusions are allowed in your prompt, do not request that the model take on the persona or accent of any specific character or individual, real or fictional.

Nov 27, 2024
Emotion/Tone - Important for ALL
You will encounter emotions/tones for many different subcategories.
For the Understanding and Reasoning subcategories, you MUST USE the provided subcategory emotion/tone. Here, we are testing whether the model can understand that the user has a specific emotional undertone.
Example: For Tone Recognition - Fearful, you must use a fearful tone in your prompt.
For the Generation subcategories, you DO NOT NEED TO EMPLOY the provided subcategory emotion/tone. If appropriate with the prompt, you may exercise the emotion/tone, but ultimately, you will explicitly ask the model to produce the emotion.
Example: For Tone Styles - Fearful, you must ask the model to act afraid, but you do not need to talk fearfully when recording the prompt.
Response Judges and Reviewers - Please understand the differences between the two cases above when grading:
The Understanding and Reasoning subcategory emotion/tone must match the selected emotion/tone.
The Generation subcategory emotion/tone must be requested in the prompt but does not have to match the selected emotion/tone.

üéß Response Judges Rating and Ranking Updates
Generally, this model's output regarding humanlikeness and expressiveness could be better. Please reevaluate when considering whether it should be a three (3) or higher.
If both responses are equally poor, please mark the Likert with a four (4) as ‚ÄúResponse 1 and 2 are Similar.‚Äù
A quick guide on Linters was added on interpreting and navigating them.

Nov 26, 2024
Justifications can be short (10-50 words). Bullets are appropriate. For reviewers, minor grammar and spelling errors are okay (do not score the task a 5, but you do not need to worry about fixing it).
Categories and subcategories were updated to reflect the latest focus of capabilities.

Nov 25, 2024
The attempt workflow has been split up into:
üé§ Prompt Recorder - crafts, annotates and records the prompt.
üéß Response Judge - evaluate the responses by rating and ranking.
Reviewers will score and provide separate feedback between Prompt Recorders and Response Judges.
Respond Judges and Reviewers: The prompt does not need to be exactly the same as what was written.

Nov 23, 2024
When you receive a response that cuts off close to the end:
Regenerate the response up to three (3) times to try and get a response that does not have a cutoff.
If you are unable to get a response that does not cut off, evaluate the response prior to the cutoff for your ratings and rankings.

Nov 22, 2024
Reminder again: Your ratings for the responses should be independent and objective and not relative to the other response. For example, if both responses are poor on Humanlikeness but Response 1 is slightly more believable, then they should be rated a 1 or 2 rather than Response 1 be rated a 4 or 5.

Nov 20, 2024
Updated to include prompt generation with task types, categories, and subcategories.
Updated Rating Dimensions and Dimension Definitions.

Nov 4, 2024
Reminder: Model responses should be rated independently, meaning the response ratings are mutually exclusive. Response 1 ratings should not be compared to Response 2 or vice versa.

Nov 1, 2024 
Rating dimensions were updated with a dimension-score matrix that better described the ratings from 1 to 5.
Reviewer Workflow added, and reviewer rubric updated



‚ö†Ô∏èPROJECT ELIGIBILITY & DOCUSIGN FOR CONSENT


The prompt recording portion of this project is not available to residents of Illinois, Texas, or Washington state. You may still participate as a response judge or reviewer if you reside in one of those states.


To record voice samples in this project, you will need to sign an agreement form via DocuSign. This will be visible as a training module, and you will receive the link via email. If you are a resident of IL, TX, or WA, please reject this agreement form - if you are empty queue after rejecting the agreement, you may notify the QMs in the Outlier Community.


IMPORTANT: Please input a personal, functioning email address into the DocuSign module email box. DO NOT input an Outlier-provided credential email address.


The agreement outlines the information that may be collected from you and how it will be used. Your participation is voluntary, and you are not obligated to provide any data if you choose not to. You may also cease participating in this project at any time. No photos, videos, scans, or social media account information will be collected for this project. This project exclusively collects voice audio files.



Project Overview
Welcome to the Speech RLHF Project! Your role is to assist in researching and training large language models (LLMs) by creating a scenario-specific prompt, recording it with the intended tone, and rating the model's response based on predefined criteria and dimensions.


Possible Responsibilities
This project involves several responsibilities based on the task types:


üé§ Prompt Recorder: Create, read and record the provided prompt then submit the task.
üéß Response Judge: Review the model responses, rate them, and rank the two responses with a justification.
üèÅReviewer: Review the prompt recording and response ratings, ranking, and justification.

You can access this specification document at any time during the task here.



Task Types
You will be assigned a specific task type for each prompt you generate. Specific descriptions are below:


üß†Understanding and Reasoning

This category focuses on prompts that guide the model in speaking in a specific tone, emotion or response length.

Example: The news about the tornado is heartbreaking.


 üë∑ Generation

This category focuses on prompts that explicitly ask the model to respond using a specific character, accent, speech pattern, emotion, or tone.

Example: Yawn and breathe deeply like you're on the verge of sleep


üßë‚Äçüíª Language and Knowledge

This category focuses on prompts that involve language-related  tasks, casual conversations, and creative or interactive exchanges.


This type of task requires exercising capabilities from the other task types. Your job is to choose at least one that fits the prompt you have in mind.


Example: Generally speaking, what do fossils tell us about our ancestors? Can you explain this to me as if you're a grumpy, old anthropologist  with a Canadian accent?

Additional capabilities employed:

Generation Category > Subcategory: Explicit Persona Control > Age and Life Stage Voices
Generation Category > Subcategory: Explicit Accent Control > Native Accents
Generation Category > Subcategory: Explicit Tone & Emotion Control > Emotional Styles


‚ú® Recap: Each task type will be related to a category and subcategory that will provide the necessary context for your prompt to target a specific goal, except for Language and Knowledge‚ÄîGeneral. In this type of task, you must select at least one category and subcategory from the other two task types.


üéè Paired Emotions

This category focuses on prompts that require tonal or emotional paralinguistics for a replier to understand (i.e., the model would not know how to respond without the additional context).


üé§ Prompt Recorders: You will not have any assigned category or subcategory for this task type

You will need to come up with a prompt that is ambiguous and would need tonal or emotional guidance for a responder  to respond appropriately.
You will then complete two tasks: (1) Record the prompt the first time with one tone/emotion and complete the rest of the task accordingly, (2) Record your prompt the second time with an alternative tone/emotion and complete the rest of the task accordingly.
The wording must be EXACTLY the same for both tasks. The paralinguistics, intonation, and expressiveness may differ, but the text itself should be exactly the same.
Recommendations
Keep your prompts short
Minimize the use of words that have strong positive or negative connotations
Use paralinguistics to convey your emotion

        üéß Response Judges

You may encounter some prompts that are repeated once with this task type. This is expected.
You should not encounter prompts repeated more than once.
Similar to Understanding and Reasoning type prompts, tone and emotion in the recording are very important for a good prompt
If a prompt fails to capture the tone or emotion indicated, it should be marked a ‚Äò1‚Äô

Example: We're moving next week.

Depending on the tone or emotion, the responder may have very different responses:

Prompt emotion Surprised: The responder may react surprisedly, "Next week?! Wow, that's soon!"
Prompt emotion Sleepy: The responder might nod, "Yeah, I feel you. It's going to be a long week."
Prompt emotion Fearful: The responder could reassure, "It's a big change, but we'll be okay."
Prompt emotion Commanding: The responder might acknowledge, "All right, I'll start packing."

üé§ Prompt Recorder Workflow





Step 1: Review Your Task Type, Category and Subcategory
Check out the Categories and Subcategories examples.




Step 2: Create a prompt based on your assigned Category
Write a short and natural prompt that meets the criteria provided in this table and in the appendix below the task flow. Colloquialisms and filler words are allowed if appropriate.




Here are some sample prompts for inspiration:


üß†Understanding and Reasoning - Specific

Category: Tone and emotion recognition

        Subcategory: Tone Recognition - Sad

Prompt: I hate being without you.


 üë∑ Generation - Specific

Category: Explicit Persona control

        Subcategory: Occupational Voices - Sports Announcer (excited, energetic)

Prompt: Narrate my son's first steps like you're a sports announcer.


üßë‚Äçüíª Language & Knowledge - General

Category: Academic Knowledge

        Subcategory: Arts - Music

Prompt: What‚Äôs the difference between a symphony and a concerto? Can you explain it to me from the perspective of a hyper-excited music theory student?

Note: The üßë‚Äçüíª Language and Knowledge example here utilizes additional capabilities: (1) Explicit Persona Control > Age and Lift Stage Voices, (2) Explicit Speed Control > Request Different Speaking Speed, and (3) Explicit Tone and Emotion Control > Emotional Styles.


üéè Paired Emotions

Category: NA

Subcategory: NA

Prompt: He really told you that?


‚ö†Ô∏èDO NOT copy and paste from the examples provided or utilize the output of an LLM to plagiarize your prompts. This violates Outlier community guidelines and will result in the removal from the project or platform.


NOTE: The entire prompt should be able to be read in 15 seconds.


Step 3: Confirm your Task Type & Tone or Emotion
Utilize the multiple choice section to:

Confirm the task type you just completed.
Choose the tone or emotion to read your prompt in.
Note: Prompts meant to elicit a specific emotion in the response may be spoken differently than the responder‚Äôs reply (e.g., a prompt in the Generation task type that is meant to elicit sympathy might be read in a sad tone).
Understanding and Reasoning task types should always select the same tone & emotion as the one assigned in the subcategory.
‚ÄúConversation‚Äù is currently not a prioritized task type.




Step 3a: Additional Capabilities Request for üßë‚Äçüíª Language and Knowledge Tasks
üßë‚Äçüíª Language and Knowledge tasks must ask for helpful information or assistance while mixing and matching capabilities from the other two (2) task types. Utilize the nested list to select the capabilities that your prompt tests the model.

  


Step 3b: Paired Emotion Set for üéè Paired Emotion Tasks
üéè Paired Emotion tasks must always come in two; thus, you must record whether this is the first time you are recording this prompt or the second recording using another emotion.





Step 4: Read, Record and Submit the Created Prompt
Carefully read the prompt you just created. When ready, press the microphone icon to start recording it. Record yourself saying the prompt naturally so it does not sound like you are reading it verbatim. Submit the task once completed.



You can edit the audio by clipping out unwanted sections. It is recommended only to clip the beginning and ends of the clips to avoid audio jumps or accidentally remove natural pauses. If there was an issue in the middle of your audio, you should rerecord it. You can rerecord by clicking the circular Redo arrow at the top of the step.












üéß Response Judge Workflow

Step 1: Review the Prompt and Selections
Evaluate the recorded prompt based on the task type, category, and subcategory.
Check the multiple-choice section selections.  Ensure the categories are selected as needed and the capabilities are selected when applicable (language  & knowledge tasks).
Correct these selections if necessary.
Listen to the prompt and evaluate the audio quality. See the Audio Quality section for issues to avoid.
DO NOT RERECORD the prompt.

Step 1a: When the Prompt is Poor and Needs to be Rerecorded
You will have a question to confirm whether the prompt meets audio quality standards.





If you encounter a poor prompt, mark it accordingly, DO NOT RERECORD the prompt, and skip to step 6. Note: these evaluations are reviewed. Using this as a way to game the system for this project is a violation of community guidelines and will result in immediate removal from the project and platform.


IMPORTANT: If you mark that the prompt recording contains one or more issues, the score awarded to the Prompt Recorder has to be 1, higher scores are only reserved for prompts with high quality that fit the required category. 


If you received a good prompt (e.g., meets audio quality standards and matches the task type, category, and subcategory accurately), mark it accordingly and continue to step 2.


Step 2: Listen to the Two Audio Responses
The user interface will present two audio responses from the model. You will receive and listen to the two audio files in this step.


If the audio files are similar, reroll the model call and re-listen (fetch a new response) until two disparate model response audios are provided. Recommended: only reroll up to three (3) times.







Step 2a: ‚úÇÔ∏è Response Cutoff
‚ö†Ô∏è With this voice model, you may encounter response cutoffs. If either of the responses is cutoff:

Please reroll the model call to get a new response until you get a noncut response. Recommended: only reroll up to three (3) times.
If, after three rerolls, you still get a response that cuts off, submit the task. In the next step, you will then mark the task accordingly.

‚ÄºÔ∏èNote: You need to listen both responses to correctly identify the cutoffs, some cutoffs are obvious and can be found quickly by looking at the waveform, but there are recordings that show some wave form that it is not a cutoff but a radio static wave displayed in the responses.


Cutoff Example 1




Cutoff Example 2



Step 3: Rating Model Responses
Rate both model responses (Response 1 and Response 2) by selecting 1-5 for each dimension.





In the first question, you will be asked whether the response was cut off. If so, mark that the response was cut off. See Response Cutoff for more info.




Evaluate the rest of the questions considering the response up to the cutoff sentence (e.g., the ‚Äúprecut response‚Äù)


Model responses should be rated independently, meaning we must evaluate each one absolutely, not relative to the other response. If both responses fail to meet expectations in a particular dimension, we should not give a higher rating to one simply because we subjectively feel it‚Äôs better. A response must be objectively better than the other to earn a higher rating in any dimension.


Another way to say it is: "The response ratings are mutually exclusive. This means the ratings for Response 1 do not affect the ratings of Response 2. And vice-versa"


For each category below, you will rate according to the 1 to 5 scale. The 1 to 5 scale would be generally defined as follows:


Score

1 - Needs Improvement

2 - Below Expectations

3 - Meets Expectations

4 - Exceeds Expectations

5 - Exceptional

Meaning

None (0%) of the category dimensions reflected in the prompt are correctly represented.

Almost none (25%) of the category dimensions reflected in the prompt are correctly represented.

Roughly half (50%) of the category dimensions reflected in the prompt are correctly represented.

Most (75%) of the category dimensions reflected in the prompt are correctly represented.

All (100%) of the category dimensions reflected in the prompt are correctly represented.


Questions to Rate
The below questions pertain to the specific categories listed below. You will be asked to provide a 1 to 5 rating against these questions. The category definitions are listed to help answer the questions.


Dimension

Guiding Question

More information

Paralinguistic Understanding

Does the model recognize the paralinguistic information (e.g., user‚Äôs non-verbal cues) in the question and respond properly?

See Examples here

See Webinar Recording here

General Content (Speech) Reasoning

Does the model's response demonstrate adequate reasoning ability to answer the question from the following perspectives: relevance, accuracy, completeness, and clarity? f

See Examples here

See Webinar Recording here

Speech Steerability

Does the model understand the explicit instructions from the question and reflect and maintain the requested changes (e.g., accent, emotion, tone, speed) accurately throughout the response as expected?

See Examples here
See Webinar Recording here

Implicit Speech Style Control

Does the model automatically adjust its speech styles, such as speed, emotion, and tone, to align with the question's style, context, and emotional cues without explicit instructions?

See Examples here

See Webinar Recording here

Audio Quality

Does the model generally have good audio quality, particularly considering speech clarity, noise, artifacts and volume consistency?

See Examples here

See Webinar Recording here

Humanlikeness

Does the speech output resemble that of a human speaker in terms of naturalness, realism, and authenticity?

See Examples here

See Webinar Recording here

Expressiveness

Does the speech output convey emotions, emphasis and prosody?

See Examples here

See Webinar Recording here


Check the Dimension Evaluation Definitions section in the appendix for a deep understanding of these dimensions.


IMPORTANT NOTE FOR IRRELEVANT DIMENSIONS: If a dimension is not relevant when evaluating a response, a rating of ‚Äò3‚Äô should be provided.


Example:  A response to a prompt may not exhibit the dimension of Speech Steerability, for instance.


Let‚Äôs take this prompt, ‚ÄúHow many types of scorpions exist in the world today?‚Äù (The model is not asked to explicitly employ a tone/emotion)


To answer the question, the model does not need to employ accents, emotions, or tones. The model was not asked to return the information in a certain accent or tone. Speech Steerability would be rated as  ‚Äò3‚Äô as this is not relevant.


Step 4: Preference Ranking
In this step, you will rank the two responses based on their overall quality and adherence to key criteria. You will use a Likert scale to rank the responses, considering several dimensions.


The ranking should be determined by considering the response characteristics from Step 6.


Ranking Scale: Use the preference ranking Likert scale to compare the responses. If Response 1 scored higher in most dimensions, it should receive a higher preference rating or vice versa.


1

2

3

4

5

6

7

Response 1 is much better

Response 1 is better

Response 1 is slightly better

Responses 1 and 2 are similar

Response 2 is slightly better

Response 2 is better

Response 2 is much better


Rank the two responses by selecting 1-7:




Step 5: Preference Justification
In this step, you will provide a written summary of the ranking scale. For example, if ‚ÄòResponse 1 is much better‚Äô was selected, why? Why did you select one response over the other?


The justification should contain roughly 10‚Äì50 words.


Use the provided free-text box to input your justification:





Tips for Writing a High-Quality Justification
‚òëÔ∏è Evaluate Content and Delivery In Conjunction

Review the content for accuracy, relevance, and clarity.
Assess the delivery for tone, style, and how well it matches the context or audience.
Ask: Does the response meet the needs of the question, and is it communicated effectively?
Note specific examples of effective or ineffective communication.

‚òëÔ∏è Focus on Details and Evidence

Pay attention to subtle cues or nuances in the response, such as phrasing or tone shifts.
Identify specific examples that illustrate the model‚Äôs positive or negative performance.
Record these examples for reference, using them to support your observations.

‚òëÔ∏è Be Objective and Consistent

Base your evaluation on observable facts, such as accuracy, clarity, and alignment with the question.
Avoid letting personal preferences or biases affect your judgment.
Apply the same evaluation criteria to all responses to maintain fairness.

‚òëÔ∏è Provide Constructive Feedback

Highlight what the model does well with specific examples.
Example: ‚ÄúThe model used clear, concise language that effectively addressed the user‚Äôs question.‚Äù
Suggest specific improvements for weaker areas.
Example: ‚ÄúThe response could include more examples to clarify complex ideas.‚Äù

Step 6: Score the Task and Provide Constructive Feedback
After reviewing the task, score the prompt recording and offer clear, actionable feedback to help the contributor improve future recordings. Focus on:

Audio quality
Naturalness and expressiveness (e.g., ‚ÄúThe tone didn‚Äôt match the apologetic tone requested‚Äù).
Alignment with the provided task type, category, and subcategory
Multiple choice selections


üèÅ Reviewer Workflow
As a reviewer, your task is to evaluate the attempers‚Äô recording, ratings, ranking, and justification. Follow these steps to ensure the quality of the task. You may listen to the audio files more than the minimum number of times suggested below.


Evaluate the created prompt based on the task type, category, and subcategory.

Check the multiple-choice section selections.
Ensure the categories are selected as needed, and the capabilities are selected when applicable (language  & knowledge tasks).


Listen to the prompt twice and evaluate the audio quality.
See the Audio Quality section for issues to avoid.
DO NOT RERECORD the prompt.

Listen to Response 1 and evaluate the ratings.
You may adjust the ratings if you disagree with them.


Listen to Response 2 and evaluate the ratings.
You may adjust the ratings if you disagree with them.


Evaluate the ranking and the justification.
You may adjust the ranking if you disagree with it; however, you must make sure to adjust the justification as well.


Score the Task and Provide Constructive Feedback for the üé§ Prompt Recorder and üéß Response Judge
üé§ Score the Prompt Recorder on Writing and Recording Quality
üéß Score the Response Judge on Rating Dimensions, Likert or Comparison Ranking, and Preference Justification
If the task needs to be redone, score the section with a (1)  at either step. If it is minor adjustments, please proceed to make the adjustments and mark the section with a (3).

Offer clear, actionable feedback to help other contributors improve future recordings. Focus on:

Suggest improving expressiveness if a prompt lacked emotion (e.g., ‚ÄúThe tone didn‚Äôt match the apologetic tone requested‚Äù).
If a rating or ranking was incorrect, explain why it was.

‚ùå DO NOT request specific characters (e.g., Homer Simpson, Achilles, Rapunzel, Tina Fey). While allusions are allowed in your prompt, do not request that the model take on the persona or accent of any specific character or individual, real or fictional.


üí° Additionally, please think creatively a little outside the box and avoid stereotyping. For example, ‚ÄúGive me a pasta recipe as an Italian chef‚Äù is oversubscribed.

Try something like, ‚ÄúCan you pretend to be my lovely Italian nonna, who‚Äôs prepping the Feast of the Seven Fishes but keeps getting interrupted cause new guests keep arriving at our house?‚Äù
Or something like, ‚ÄúYou are an Italian painter in 1569, and Giuseppe Arcimboldo has just showcased his latest set of paintings, The Four Seasons. What is your critique? Do you love it or hate it?‚Äù

Common Prompt Errors
Please note the following common prompt errors:


 ‚ùå Incorrect Category

In some cases, the attempter uses an incorrect category when creating their prompt. That is why we highlight the need to carefully identify your task type as well as the category and subcategory assigned. Remember to review the list of examples to streamline your prompt creation process.


 ‚ùå Creating the Prompt as a Response

The task is to create a prompt, not to respond to the example provided or write a response. Double-check your prompt specifications and follow the instructions.


 ‚ùå Creating the Prompt and a Response

In some tasks, you will be required to create a ‚ÄúMulti-Turn‚Äù prompt. Remember to follow the format provided in the instructions and do not write the responses; only the prompts are required.


 ‚ùå Weak Grammar

When writing your prompts, start with a capital letter and end with a point.


‚ùå Language & Knowledge Additional Capabilities Selection

For the Language & Knowledge prompts, we need to verify that the prompt matches at least one of the capabilities listed from the other task types. The prompt should be as explicit as possible when required to relate it to one of the capabilities.

Does the model recognize the explicit paralinguistic information in the question and respond to it appropriately?


Can you tell me what my accent is?

I think that‚Äôs a British accent.

Does the model appropriately recognize and respond to the implicit paralinguistic information in the question?

I got a B on my exam. (Sad tone)


I got a B on my exam. (Happy tone)




Aww, sorry to hear that you didn't get the grade you were hoping for‚Ä¶


Woohoo, congratulations on getting a B! That's amazing news! You must be thrilled to have done so well. Keep up the fantastic work!


In other words (no pun intended)..


Paralinguistic refers to the use of nonverbal aspects of speech such as body language, gestures, facial expressions, tone, and pitch of voice.


Because this is an audio-only project, visual forms of paralinguistic such as body language and facial expressions will not be used when recording prompts. And thus the model will not be using that information to understand the paralinguistic used. Vocal forms of paralinguistic, such as tone, emotion, accent, speed, pauses, etc are all applicable and used to emphasize the prompt intent.

These vocal forms of paralinguistic can be explicit or implicit:
If explicit, the prompt recorder may angrily record the question, "Can you tell what emotion I'm conveying?". If the model answers that it is an angry tone, then it correctly understood the paralinguistic. In this case, it was explicitly asked to understand the emotion used.
If implicit, the prompt recorder may angrily record, "I HAVE to go into the city to see my mother.". If the model says, "That's great news..", then the model response incorrectly understood the implied paralinguistic used in the recording.

The prompt recording employed a sad and disappointing tone. The response correctly identified the emotion of the prompt by using comforting words in the response: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry to hear that‚Äù as well as ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs disappointing..‚Äù.

Incorrect Paralinguistic Understanding

Link

Link

The model response incorrectly identifies a tone (non verbal) that is not used by the prompt recording and answers using comforting words when comforting words should not be used. The prompt recorder did not show an emotion that would lead someone to think they were feeling down. A more appropriate emotion used by the prompt recorder may be frustrated, at best.


General Content (Speech) Reasoning
The model must respond in a manner that fully addresses the user prompt. Answers must be relevant and timely, reflecting an understanding of the context of the user‚Äôs full request.

Sample Prompt

Sample Response

Relevance

Does the response directly address the question asked?
Is the information pertinent to the topic?
How many species of bears are native to North America?

There are three species of bears native to North America: the black bear, the brown bear, and the polar bear.

Accuracy

Is the information factually correct and up-to-date?
What was the score of the last Dodgers game?

The Dodgers‚Äô last game was Game 5 of the World Series, and they beat the Yankees 7-6 to secure the franchise‚Äôs eighth World Series title.

Completeness

Does the response cover all aspects of the question?
Are there any obvious important details or explanations that need to be included?
What‚Äôs the name of a baby horse?

A baby horse is called a foal, but specifically, male foals are called colts, and female foals are called fillies.

Clarity

Is the content presented clearly and understandably?
Are complex ideas explained effectively?
How do you measure square feet?

To measure the square footage of an area, you multiply the length and the width. For example, if a room is 12 feet long and 6 feet wide, it would be 72 square feet in area.

Appropriateness of Voice Response

Is the response structured in a way that is easy to follow when listened to rather than read?
Determine if the level of detail is appropriate for a voice agent, avoiding information overload.
Does the response avoid relying on visual cues or formats (e.g., bullet points, charts) unsuitable for audio?



When we think about Speech Reasoning, we pay attention to the content of the response. We want to make sure the content makes sense.


If the prompt asks for the population of Washington D.C., does it give you the correct population for Boston? The population of Boston is not relevant to the question and therefore would not follow good reasoning. Even if the response provided the correct population for Boston, it did not answer the original question.

If the prompt recorder provides a statement such as, ‚ÄúI just got a promotion, I‚Äôm so happy!‚Äù, we will evaluate the response‚Äôs ability to recognize the tone and emotion of the prompt. In this case, Speech Reasoning would not be a relevant evaluation criteria. In this example, Speech Reasoning would be rated as a ‚Äò3‚Äô because this dimension is not being assessed.

Implementation

Does the response reflect the requested aspects accurately?
Are all specified aspects (e.g., accent, emotion, tone, speed) appropriately adjusted in the response?
Talk to me in a British accent, but like you‚Äôre ecstatic about something.

You bet, bruv! What else can I help with? (in a happy tone/British accent)

Responsiveness

Is the requested adjustment immediate in the response following the instruction?
Does the model maintain the adjustments throughout the response as expected?
Speak slowly with a happy tone in a British accent

Happy to! Is this slow enough for you? (in a happy, British tone)


If a prompt recorder asks the model to use a certain accent, emotion, tone, speed, etc, does the response do it?


Here, we are looking to see if the model follows verbal instruction to use accent, emotion, tone, speed, voice-mimicking sound effects, etc.

Think of Speech Steerability as Speech Reasoning but for changes to the paralinguistic information.

This is different from Paralinguistic Understanding as Paralinguistic Understanding is the ability for the model to recognize paralinguistic used by the prompt recorder. For Speech Steerability, we are assessing the model‚Äôs ability to use paralinguistic information (tone, accents, emotion, speed, etc.) via an explicit instruction.

Does it avoid being overly dramatic or so subtle that it‚Äôs nearly impossible to decipher?
Yeah, I guess it wasn‚Äôt that much of a big deal to reschedule our dinner. Just annoying, you know?

Definitely. Might not be the end of the world, but still certainly annoying. Did you get a chance to find another place to get dinner another day? (supportive but not dramatic, not stuck on the minor slight).

FAQs
This quick-reference guide addresses common concerns and issues individuals may face with instructions on how to resolve them.


Question

Answer

How good should the sound quality of my recordings be?

Recording sound quality (very important!) should be clear with no background noise. If you have a professional microphone (e.g., condenser microphone), record with it in a carotid pattern and use a pop filter. If not, we recommend using voice isolation if available (e.g., Mac model 2018 or newer). Record in quiet, soft (e.g., carpeted or blanketed) environments away from walls.


See the Audio Quality Issues section for more details.

What if I don‚Äôt feel comfortable recording a given task?

A task should be skipped if you don‚Äôt feel you can fit the tone, you don‚Äôt feel you can fit the persona, or you aren‚Äôt comfortable for any other reason.

Where can I get any questions answered?

Ask questions in the ‚ÄùOutlier Community‚Äù channel (you may need to create an account).

Common Audio Issues and How to Solve Them
Here are some common microphone and audio quality issues you should be aware of and avoid. We recognize that some of the recommended equipment may only be readily available for some individuals.


Audio Issue

Description

Solution

Hiss, Hum, Buzz (Mic Background Noise)

High-pitched noise or white noise in the background or low-pitched, continuous hum or buzz, often electrical.

Adjust microphone sensitivity, use noise isolation techniques, record in a quieter environment, or move away from sources of interference or noise

Breath or Outside Noise (Manual Background Noise)

Audible inhalation or exhalation sounds that can be distracting, paper or object rustling, or other outside noise.

Plosive Sounds (Mic Pops)

Burst of air hitting the microphone from ‚ÄòP‚Äô or ‚ÄòB‚Äô sounds, distorting the audio.

Use a pop filter and maintain proper mic distance.

Popping or Clicking

Sudden, sharp sounds interrupting the recording, often short and loud.

Secure microphone connections and ensure software settings are stable.

Reverb (Room Echo)

Sound reflects off surfaces, causing an echo effect that makes the audio unclear.

Record in spaces with acoustic treatments like blankets or soundproofing.

Distortion/Clipping

Harsh, crackling audio when the input levels are too high.

Lower input gain, reduce shouting and adjust levels to be within an acceptable range.

Boominess (Proximity Effect)

The voice sounds too deep or muffled

Adjust mic placement, especially with directional microphones.

Sibilance

Excessive sharpness on ‚ÄúS‚Äù and ‚ÄúSH‚Äù sounds.

Adjust mic placement.

Volume (Weak Signal)

The volume is too low, requiring significant amplification that introduces noise.

Increase microphone gain and adjust mic position.



Example of Bad vs. Good Prompt Crafting

Bad Prompt

Good Prompt

Comments














From this example, we can identify a grammar error by not using the capital letter to start the prompt.


Given that this task is a ‚ÄúLanguage and Knowledge‚Äù task, we can find some more errors:


The prompt on the left needs to be explicit to meet the capability of ‚ÄúExplicit Response Length Control,‚Äù for example:
Prompt: ‚ÄúMy best friend lied to me about kissing my boyfriend. What should I do? Tell me what to do in detail.‚Äù

The task can be corrected by only selecting the applicable capabilities, such as ‚ÄúTone and Emotion Recognition > Tone Recognition.‚Äù Based on the examples provided, we can identify that this prompt can be read in an angry tone and match correctly with the requirements.

So, for ‚ÄúLanguage and Knowledge‚Äù tasks, It is important to select the applicable capability based on the prompt being created.





From the task on the left, we can identify the following mistakes:

The prompt has several grammar errors.
The prompt is responding to the example provided.








From the task on the left side, we can identify two (2) mistakes:

The task has both a prompt and a response.
The chosen capability was ‚ÄúExplicit Person Control > Age and Life Stage Voices,‚Äù and the prompt does not explicitly mention this capability.

From the task on the right side, we can see how the prompt has been corrected to be more explicit to match the capability, and the response has been removed (again, we are not asking for a response to the prompt, only for the prompt). 


An important point about this task is that the main point of the task type ‚ÄúLanguage and Knowledge‚Äù is not lost since the prompt asks for useful information based on the categories assigned and adds the capability requirement by asking to ‚Äútalk as a senior citizen.‚Äù





Linters

You may encounter "Linter Warnings" displayed as pop-up boxes. These are designed to help you ensure alignment with the correct task type, category, subcategory, and, where applicable, the appropriate  tone and emotions. If the warnings appear in yellow, you can dismiss them after review by selecting the "Dismiss Feedback" option.





If you encounter a red linter warning, as shown in the image below, carefully review the message in the pop-up box, as it likely indicates an issue with your task that requires immediate attention.







Sensitive Topics
When creating prompts, please avoid sensitive topics such as hate, discrimination, firearms, drugs, religion, politics, race, violence, sex, gender, and sexual orientation. There are limited number of exceptions:

Romantic or flirty prompts are okay as long as they are not sexual in nature.
‚ÄúLight,‚Äù not derogatory profanity may be employed.
Objective, fact-based questions about politics may be asked if that is the provided topic area.
Examples of inappropriate prompts: ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it great that the French government is collapsing?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy did people for Trump?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy are all liberals sensitive snowflakes?‚Äù


Paralinguistics? What‚Äôs this project trying to achieve?
Paralinguistics refers to the aspects of spoken communication that go beyond the literal meaning of the words. This includes emotion or tone of voice, volume, pitch, speech rate, and non-verbal sounds. You may also encounter the word ‚Äúprosody.‚Äù Prosody is a subset of paralinguistics that focuses specifically on the rhythm, stress, pauses, melody, and intonation patterns of speech.


Both provide more context, structure, emotion or mood, and emphasis in spoken communication than written communication, enhancing how spoken messages are understood and interpreted. They make it a clear differentiator between text and audio-type projects and models in both terms of input and output. In terms of input, we want audio models to understand the paralinguistics behind our speech. For example, ‚ÄúI saw my Timmy at the supermarket today‚Äù could be interpreted as a positive or negative encounter, which can be detected based on the voice and result in two different model responses. Regarding output, we want to improve audio model capabilities to sound more human and empathetic and achieve other capabilities (e.g., talk at different speeds or use different impressions or accents).
